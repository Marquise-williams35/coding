# create a new document called pythonReview.py and answer the following
# questions. 

# Question 1
# Build a program that determines if a student has submitted their class work 
# and homework assignment. The program should use an operator that allows 
# for evaluating 2 conditions and determining if the conditions are true 
# or false , then answer the following questions: 
#homework_finished = True
#Classwork_finished = True

#print(homework_finished == True and Classwork_finished ==True)


# Question 2
# Create a function that will take in a string as an argument and output 
# that string in reverse order.

# hint: look into string reverse in w3schools

# Question 3
# Create a number guessing function where the program will continuously 
# ask the user to enter a number until the guess the number correctly. 
# Your program should also give the user information on if their guess 
# is close to the correct number. If the guess is above the correct number 
# it should tell the user it is too high and try again. 
# If the guess is below the number, it should tell the user it is too low, 
# it should tell them it is too low and to guess again. Once the user gets 
# it correct the program should congratulate them, stop, and tell them how 
# many attempts they made.

#def NumberguessingGame():  
#    for x in range 
 #   print('please enter a number')
  #  answer = 8
   # if answer != 8:
    #    print('congrats you win')
    #else:
    #   print('wrong answer, try again')
